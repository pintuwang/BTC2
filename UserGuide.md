# 📈 MSTR Strategic Monitor: User Guide

This guide explains how to interpret the interactive chart to gain a mathematical edge when trading MicroStrategy (MSTR) options, using Bitcoin (BTC) as a directional engine.

## 🧐 Component Breakdown

### 1. The "Magnets" (Max Pain Lines)
* **🟢 MSTR Max Pain (Solid Line):** Represents the strike price where the most options expire worthless. Market makers try to "pin" the stock here to minimize their losses.
* **🔵 BTC Max Pain (Dashed Line):** Shows the gravitational center for Bitcoin. Because MSTR is a BTC proxy, this line acts as a "leading indicator."

### 2. The OI Bars (Open Interest)
* **📊 Green Bars (Calls):** Significant resistance zones. High call OI acts as a "ceiling" that is hard to break.
* **📊 Red Bars (Puts):** Significant support zones. Large put walls represent a "floor" where institutional buyers are likely to step in.

### 3. The Time Markers
* **◆ Red Diamonds:** These mark **Monthly Expirations** (3rd Friday). These have the highest liquidity and the strongest "pinning" effect on price.

## 🚀 Trading Scenarios & "Edge" Actions

| Scenario | Market Signal | Proposed Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Safety Net** | MSTR Price is well above a massive **Red OI Bar**. | **SELL PUTS.** Use the strike at or below that red bar. You are "selling at the floor." |
| **The Magnet Pull** | MSTR Spot Price is $10+ away from the **Green Max Pain Line**. | **ANTICIPATE MEAN REVERSION.** Expect the price to drift toward the Green Line as expiration Friday approaches. |
| **The Engine Lead** | **BTC Line (Blue)** is trending up, but **MSTR Line (Green)** is flat. | **BULLISH BIAS.** MSTR is likely lagging behind BTC and will eventually "snap" upward to re-correlate. |
| **The Monthly Pin** | It is Wednesday/Thursday of a **Monthly Expiration (◆)** week. | **CLOSE POSITIONS.** Volatility often drops as the price gets "pinned" to Max Pain. Take profits before the Friday theta crush. |

## 🛠 Using the "Safety Score"
The Safety Score (0–10) in the top-right of your dashboard is your final filter:

* **Score 8-10:** Optimal for selling Puts. Max Pain and OI floors are both below the current price, acting as a double shield.
* **Score 5-7:** Neutral. The price is stable, but there is no strong "pull" upward.
* **Score 0-4:** High Risk. The "Magnets" are pulling the price *down* toward your strike. Avoid selling puts here.

> **Pro-Tip:** If the **Trend Indicator** shows `▼ Spot -3%` but the **Safety Score** is `9`, the market is panicking, but the "math" says the floor should hold. This is often the best time to enter a trade for high premium.
